# AtmoBurn Services - Fleet Helper
This is Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) script for Atmoburn game (https://www.atmoburn.com/).

## What it does
Once it has many functions, which now are either obsolete (game does already have this features itself), or not legal anymore etc.
Still, it adds some controls to fleet navigation screen:
 - move to global position right above the current system (z+1 global)
 - move to global position right bellow the current system (z-1 global)
 - move to point specified by polar coordinates - direction and distance

## How to install
- You should have Tampermonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or equivalent
- Open `abs-fleet-helper.user.js` file and go "Raw" in your browser - Tampermonkey should offer you "Install" button - and thats it.

## How to use
On fleet screen there is combo box with options. Some options are (not) available when outside of system.
